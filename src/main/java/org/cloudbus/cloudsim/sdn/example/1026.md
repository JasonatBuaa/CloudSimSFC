Increasing the price for the wealthest class to reduce the hire rate of VMs, thus increasing the QoS of other classes.

Markov decision process, CP gain maximization.

Q-learning algorithm that does not need the probability transition

The Q-learning algorithm (method) does not need the explicit expression of the state transition probility and it can handle MDP problems with large state spaces efficiently

Questions: 1. what is the QoS metrics; 2. The relationship of demand classes and clients; 3. Whether and How is the dynamic pricing policy used in this research.
