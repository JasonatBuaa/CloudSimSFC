Increasing the price for the wealthest class to reduce the hire rate of VMs, thus increasing the QoS of other classes.

Markov decision process, CP gain maximization.

Request admission control policy : RAC

resource adaption control policy

Q-learning algorithm that does not need the probability transition

The Q-learning algorithm (method) does not need the explicit expression of the state transition probility and it can handle MDP problems with large state spaces efficiently

Questions: 1. what is the QoS metrics; 2. The relationship of demand classes and clients; 3. Whether and How is the dynamic pricing policy used in this research.
