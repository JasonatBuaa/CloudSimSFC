Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing in response to your advertisement in The Times newspaper yesterday for the position of executive secretary.

I enclose a copy of my CV as requested and I would like to briefly explain why I am suitable for the job.

I recently graduated from the Miami School for Secretaries with a diploma in secretarial skills.

Prior to this I worked in several large companies in New York and Chicago as an office clerk and assisted the secretaries in many areas of their work.

I am hard working, well organized and have a polite telephone manner.

I feel I will be a good member of your team if you decide to take me on.

Yours faithfully,

Grace Comings


On the mountainside there is a battle of the aliens. The once almost universal blue of the Alaskan Lupin is being smothered by the taller white mass of flowers from a tougher weed.

Warmth is transforming Iceland. Short grass and tiny ground-hugging plants, typical of cold and rocky areas, are no longer the only plants that can survive.

The Lupin, a tough, cold-resistant plant, was introduced deliberately by the government from similar climes in Alaska 50 years ago to reverse erosion and add nitrogen to the soil. It has been so successful it covers vast areas of open country, so much so that there is serious concern it is out of control.

Now a new uninvited invader has entered the fray - but this is a weed of temperate climes - Cow Parsley. How it arrived is not known but it probably came from seeds trapped in the mud of a tourist's boot. This summer there are hundreds of thousands of plants smothering both the Lupin and all other local vegetation.

Iceland's greatest asset, its fish stocks, are also on the move. The capelin on which the cod feed are disappearing northwards because the water is too warm. Monkfish, once a rarity because the sea was too cold, are now an important commercial catch. Shrimp are far fewer because cod, deprived of capelin to eat, and haddock in increasing numbers, are eating them before they can be caught for human consumption.

The new warmth in Iceland is not just changing the sort of plants that can grow here, it is melting the glaciers and ice caps and changing lifestyles too.

British tourists with winter coats arrive to find long-legged girls in hot pants and T-shirts sitting outside on the pavement cafes in the capital Reykjavik. The country's population is also on the increase, up to 280,000 from a low of 40,000 during the mini-ice age of the 18th century.

Unlike most of the rest of the planet, climate change offers a lot of advantages for Iceland. Twenty years ago it was not possible to grow barley because it was too cold for grain to ripen. Ten years ago in the extreme south farmers succeeded in getting a crop for winter fodder - it was the first harvest since the time of the first Viking settlers. This year farmers are planting barley all over the country.

The change is so rapid that the country's scientists cannot believe it will continue. For the last two years temperatures have been the highest since records began in the country in 1822 and, judging by the Greenland ice cores, any time since the medieval warm period when the Vikings arrived in Iceland. Everyone believes that soon there must be a swing back to colder times.


Whether we are lighting our houses, washing our clothes, refrigerating our food or running our computers, energy is an essential of modern life. We use it in most of the things we do. It creates comfort and convenience; helps keep us entertained and healthy. Without it our civilization would collapse.

Yet there is also a heavy price. Traditional methods of power generation have created a legacy of acid rain, oil spills and - despite billions of pounds of research - nuclear waste, issues all of which need to be tackled. That price never appears on the quarterly bill. Renewable energy comes from sources that will remain sustainable long after fossil fuels become scarce. Photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity, wind turbines that exploit Britain's climate, hydro-power which captures energy from falling water, and wave power which captures energy from the sea are some of the main sources. The potential for the effective use of renewable sources of energy in this country is huge, but its implementation is poor.

What is the cost of using non-renewable sources? Most serious of all is the contribution to climate change. We have been steadily pumping carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere.  The carbon dioxide creates a blanket round the earth. Heat which would normally disappear into space cannot escape, and is reflected back to be soaked up by the oceans. The world gets hotter. This is the Greenhouse Effect. Is it a coincidence that 10 of the 11 hottest years on record have occurred since 1980, with 1998 the hottest year ever recorded?

Europe has seen the average temperature increase by 0.8C this century, and the World Health Organization warned in June that global warming could result in mosquitoes spreading malaria and encephalitis through Britain and the northern hemisphere. Exceptional weather in New York City created perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes and helicopters were used to spray the entire city with insecticide. Large parts of England suffered their worst floods ever last year. Tony Blair's government has recognized climate change as "one of the greatest environmental threats facing the world today". The government's chief scientist says the Gulf Stream, which makes Britain's climate so benign, could be halted.

Nowhere is immune. In the Arctic, where temperatures are higher than at any time during the last three centuries, the ice is melting. Wildlife cannot adapt fast enough, and polar bears, walruses and whales are losing their feeding grounds. Marine biologists reported in July that most of the world's coral reefs could die within the next century. With predictions of global temperatures rising by a further 3.5C over the next 100 years, worse is likely to be in store. The impact could be felt increasingly within many of our lifetimes, and certainly in the lifetimes of our children. Last year more people were uprooted by natural disasters than by wars, according to the Red Cross, which warned of a series of "super-disasters" precipitated by climate change.

An instance of the problem is an input specified to the problem. An instance of the Clique problem is a graph G (V,E) and a positive integer K, and the problem is to check whether a clique of size K exists in G. Since an NP-Complete problem, by definition, is a problem which is both in NP and NP-hard, the proof for the statement that a problem is NP-Complete consists of two parts.

1. The problem itself is in NP class
2. All other problems in NP class can be polynomial-time reducible to that. (B is polynomial-time reducible to C is denoted as B$\leq\rho$C)

TCAM is an expensive, power-hungry resource and as a result the number of flow table entries (forwarding rules) available for content filtering is limited in hardware switches. 

Openflow switches use Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) for high speed flow-entry lookup. It is quite evident that to support arbitrary application topology in hybrid cloud scenario, multiple flow entries might be deployed on each Openflow switch. Besides, with the continuous allocation of new VM instances, the VN topology would experience a fast growth. More flow entries are needed to provision the virtual network.

Besides, the number of VM instances in hybrid cloud is also expected to keep increasing, to deploy a virtual network for the VMs call for an increasing demand of flow entries.

network virtualization requires supporting isolated virtual networks for individual customers with the illusion that VMs in the virtual network are running on their own private IP network.

VMs in one virtual network should be able to communicate with one another


However, this flexibility comes at a cost, especially with respect to scaling the control plane.

Once the TCAM is exhausted, the switch starts to 

drop packets leading to the TCAM exhaustion attack. 

A small number of offload flows installed by the control plane diverts the vast majority of the traffic in the cluster away from the Hoverboards.

Avoid locks and costly synchronization, optimize memory locality, use hugepages, avoid thread handoffs, end-to-end batching, and avoid system calls. For example, the Fast Path only uses system calls for Coprocessor thread wakeups and virtual interrupts. The Fastpath uses lockfree Single Producer / Single Consumer (SPSC) packet rings and channels for communication with control and Coprocessor threads.

Achieving the performance and security benefits that middleboxes offer, however, is highly complex.
This complexity stems from the need to carefully plan the network topology, manually set up rules to route traffic through the desired sequence of middleboxes, and implement safeguards for correct operation in the presence of failures and overload.


This mechanism allows HCNet to achieve a complete L2 virtualization that is transparent to tenants.

VMs in one network should be able to communicate with one another, to internal Cloud provider services, to third party providers, and to the Internet, all subject to customer policy while isolated from actions in other virtual networks.

Hereafter, for simplicity, we will use the term
We use a pseudo-random replacement policy, for simplicity, and have found it to be effective in practice.
Clearly, due to the importance of flows in the upstream paths, a merge on a switch based on flow information local to that switch is not the most optimal solution. As a result, while calculating the cost of a possible merge on a switch, we propose to consider the global view of the network state to avoid as much unnecessary traffic as possible due to aggregation.
Though the problem has been shown to be NP-hard, the availability of this large body of literature and algorithms permits us to use these powerful techniques to attack the ruleset minimization problem.
Without careful design the controller still needs to install four flow entries for each communicating pair of VMs.
A VM is only significant in terms of its connected virtual switch, and is hidden from the rest of the L2 network behind the virtual switch.

By shifting from traditional primitives and embracing network-wide centralized control, modern virtualization systems allow the complete decoupling of the virtual network from its physical realization.

However, aggregation/merging of filters may compromise preciseness of the filters with respect to the subscriber interest they represent, increasing unnecessary traffic in the network.

We reconsider the capabilities of the underlying substrate network, to make the substrate network more supportive of the VN embedding problem. This allows us to create simpler embedding algorithms that make more efficient use of the substrate resources, without compromising on the challenges listed above.

In HCNet, only access switch (software switch on host servers) and gateway switch (mostly hardware switch) can become the scalability bottleneck. 

Next, we demonstrate that with the aforementioned packet processing pipeline in HCNet, the flow space consumption on these switches are also controlled within a reasonable boundary. We first analyze the access switch, denoted as  $S$.

Set $T$ contains the tenants $t_{1}$, $t_{2}$ ,$\dots$, $t_{|T|}$ in hybrid cloud. For each access switch $s_j \in S ( j = 1,2,\dotsb,|S|$), denote the flow space capacity as $s_j^{cap}$. The current flow space consumption of $s_{j}$ can be calculated by applying function $f(\cdot)$ on switch $s_{j}$, i.e., $f(s_j)$.

 The universal collection of VMs in hybrid cloud environment is $H$. Denote the set of VMs that belong to tenant $t_{i}$ as $H_{i} = \{h_i^k|i;k=1,\cdots,|H_i|\}$.
 Function $g(\cdot)$ gives the set of VMs on switch $s_{j}$. An indicator $x_{ij}^k$ is used to specify whether the $k$th VM of tenant $t_i$ is connected on switch $s_j$ or not, $x_{ij}^k = 1$ means ,and $x_{ij}^k = 0$ means . Hence, we have $g(s_i) = \sum_{i,k}x_{ij}^k$.
   
   <!-- is $H{j} = \{h_i^j|j\}$. -->

Now we investigate the extreme case, where each VM on a switch need to communicate with all other switches on other hosts. 








Assume we have switch $s_1$ to which connects the VM of tenants $t_{1}$, $t_{2}$ ,$\dots$, $t_{m}$. We then note the set of $t_{i}$'s VMs connected to $s_{1}$ as $H_i$, the remainder of tenant $t_{i}$'s VMs in this system as $\complement{H_i}$. Besides, we note the set of subnets which VMs in $H_i$ belong to as $S_{i}$, the set of subnets which VMs in $\complement{H_i}$ belong to as $\complement{S_{i}}$. For tenant $t_{i}$, the worst case happens when the two following conditions are true: \textcircled{1} Every VM in $H_i$ belongs to a different subnet, i.e. $\left| S_i \right|$ == $\left| H_i \right|$. \textcircled{2} Subnets which VMs in $H_i$ belong to and subnets which VMs in $\complement{H_{i}}$ belong to are totally different, i.e. $S_i$ $\cap$ $\complement{S_i}$ = $\varnothing$. In this situation, mapping relations between IP and MAC of every VM belongs to $t_{i}$ has to be recorded. Thus, in the worst case, the number of flow entries on switch $s_{i}$ can be represented as:



\begin{equation}
```math
N_{s_{i}} = \sum_{t\in T}^{t} n_{t} = O(N_{tenant})
```
\end{equation}

where $T$ represents the set of tenants who have VMs connected to $s_{i}$, $N_{tenant}$ represents the total number of VMs of these tenants, $n_{t}$ represents the number of the VMs that belong to tenant $t$.

In an actual scene, $N_{f}$ and $N_{S_{i}}$ is obviously not in the same magnitude because there are thousands of tenants in one cloud and it is also unlikely for a single switch to be used by every tenant. In conclusion, while we offloading those flows to switches, HCNet is able to limit the number of flow entries on gateway devices. consequently, the overall netw ork is scalable.
